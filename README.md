# Welcome to our IT Solutions Project!ðŸš€âœ¨


## First! The prototype!
The prototype is one of the main aspects of creating any application, whether a web or a mobile one! We used Figma to create the layout of each page, making sure that we are all have the same vision that we are going for. Here:https://www.figma.com/design/f35fsTTMJJyhxBmXxIKEJd/405PROTO?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=irio4XYRlxKix34q-0

## Home page

The first page that the website opens to is the landing page also known as the home page.

### Morphing Gradients animation:
On this page, we decided to make it as interactive as possible with the Morphing Gradients animation in the background that follows the movement of the mouse. 
We used the `addEventListener` alongside the  `removeEventListener`. The `UseEffect` helps to track the user's cursor position `curX`, and `curY` is the current position of the interactive blob.
while `tgX`, and `tgY` are the target cursor positions.

**CSS Structure and animation**
<ul>
<li>A set of animated div elements (.g1 to .g5) using radial gradients and CSS animations.</li>
<li>A div.gradient-bg that defines the background area.</li>
<li>A .text-container holding the main hero title.</li>
<li>A @keyframes (like moveInCircle, moveVertical, moveHorizontal) animate each gradient blob in its unique pattern.</li>
<li>The gradient colors, circle sizes, and blending modes are declared in:root</li>
</ul>

### React Reusable Component: 
### Header
`Link` from `react-router-dom` is used to allow the transition between the pages, and we also reused the Button component for the `Let's Talk!` button. 
for the header appearance `.Header_Style` to align the menu, make it fixed on top of the page and also the ` background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.112);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);` code is used to give the header the glassy look.
also the `nav a:hover` is used to create a shadow beneath the object the user hovers over.
    
### Footer
`.FooterContainer` to create a container at the end of the page. There is nothing else that deserves mentioning since it reuses the same list of the header.

### Interactive Button
this reusable button is used across all web applications. The `Button(props)` function uses two `props`. `props.link` to take the user from one page to another and `props.name` allows the developer to change the title of the button. We also use `Link` from `react-router-dom` to allow the transition between the pages and the `.Button: hover` is also used to change the color of the button when the user's mouse hovers over the button.

## Services page
This page is responsible for displaying the services.
It includes a brief description, a dynamic list of services from the backend database, and a button linking to the contact page.

**CSS Structure:**
<ul>
<li>.Page, .title, .text: These classes are used to organize the content.</li>
<li>.services-section: Defines the upper part of the page, including the background and intro text.</li>
<li>.service-box, .service-title and .service-desc: These classes are used to structure and style the services data.</li>
<li>.End-Page: Contains the final part of the page.</li>
</ul>

## Backend
To handle the backend, we created `Services_list` component.
This component dynamically fetches and displays a list of services from the backend.
It uses the `useEffect` to fetch data.
The data is fetched from the endpoint:
http://localhost/Api/get_services.php
The backend returns a list of services in JSON format
it handles any errors that occur. 
Each service is rendered inside a styled box using CSS classes (`.service-box`, `.service-title`, `.service-desc`).
This component will be used in Services page

## The database
This application uses a MySQL database set up via AMPPS, with PHP scripts to connect and retrieve data.
<ul>
<li>Database name: it_solutions</li>
<li>Table name: services</li>
<li>Attributes:</li>
<ul>
<li>id (Primary Key, auto-increment)</li>
<li>name (VARCHAR)</li>
<li>description (TEXT)</li>
</ul>
</ul>

**db.php - Database Connection**
This file establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";  
$username = "root";         
$password = "mysql";             
$dbname = "it_solutions";   

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

**get_services.php - Fetch Services**
This file retrieves all services from the services table and returns them as JSON.
```php
<?php
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
include 'db.php';

header('Content-Type: application/json');

$sql = "SELECT id, name, description FROM services";
$result = $conn->query($sql);

$services = [];

while($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $services[] = $row;
}

echo json_encode($services);

$conn->close();
?>
```
This setup allows the React frontend to fetch content from the backend using fetch() in the Services_list component.

Note: These two files are located in the www folder inside the AMPPS directory.
